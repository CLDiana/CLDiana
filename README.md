### I Currently Host multiple servers at OVH in Beauharnois, Quebec, Canada.
### I want to make them as relyable and efficient as possible, while keeping them as secure as they can be by implementing best practices, encrypting all the data at rest as well as in transit, using accounts for their role specific features, ensuring High Availability as High Scaling and optimal performances to use the ressources as best as they can be while idle to compile and test the software, releasing versions that pass all the tests as well as static and dynamic analysis as binaries with an increased minor version, and major changes and updates as major version number increased.
